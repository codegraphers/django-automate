# Django Automate

**The admin-first automation framework for millions of developers.**

Django Automate provides a robust, strictly typed foundation for building LLM agents, RAG pipelines, and connector integrations, all manageable via a powerful Admin Studio.

## Key Features

- **Admin Studio**: Test prompts, replay executions, and inspect correlation traces visually.
- **Provider Abstraction**: Switch between OpenAI, Anthropic, or local LLMs with zero code changes.
- **RAG Pipeline**: Built-in document ingestion, chunking, and vector store abstraction.
- **Connectors**: Secure integrations with Slack, Webhooks, and more, using strictly typed specs.
- **Observability**: Structured JSON logging, metrics, and OpenTelemetry tracing out of the box.
